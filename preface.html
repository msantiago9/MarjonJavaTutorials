            The scope of the former question should be extended a bit: <strong>why learn anything in general?</strong>
            What good is the pursuit of knowledge? Perhaps by being here you admit to having at least a baseline
            interest in
            the machinations of your own computers. The computers you likely use every day, the computers that've
            brought people to the Moon and back, the computers that've both simplified and complicated our world,
            who’ve connected every single
            corner of the planet to every single other corner. Maybe you feel somewhat of an obligation to understand
            how the pieces fit. Or maybe you’ve been enamoured by the prospect of earning that silicon valley six-figure
            income. Or maybe you just want that grade, and AP CompSci was a no-brainer to the alternatives. The truth
            is, there are so many reasons to learn that I <em>cannot</em> pick one for you.</p>
        <p>The answer to the second question, <strong>“why Java?”</strong>, or more specifically, <strong>“why
                <em>start</em> with Java?”</strong> is equally frustrating. I would be lying if I said I had a
            definitive reason as for why you should choose Java as your first programming language over the likes of
            <strong>Python, JavaScript, C#, C++, PHP, or Ruby.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The cold, hard truth is this: if we were to extend this question to <em>“Which language should I learn
                first?”</em> You will arrive with a large number of equally wrong answers, such as “Python is the best
            first programming language” or “C++ is the right choice for Computer Science.” They’re wrong in the sense
            that they are framing their favorite language as the end-all be-all first language to learn, when in reality
            the best first language is the one that gets the thing you want to accomplish done. Pick a problem or
            skillset you want to complete, research the technologies that have solved similar problems, and master them.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Forcing yourself to learn something specifically because someone else believes it's the best way to learn
            programming is a quick way to hate programming and learning in general.
        </h3>

        <p>Are you interested in developing websites? Start with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, dabble in React and other JS
            frameworks, learn how backend frameworks work like Node or Django, and don’t forget your database.</p>
        <p>Do you want to build mobile applications? Learn Java and Kotlin for Android, Objective-C and Swift for iOS.
            Want to build for both OS? Learn cross-platform development frameworks like Flutter and React-Native.</p>
        <p>What about video games? You would be hard pressed not to choose C++ or C#, along with a development engine of
            your choice. Also, study a bit of game design and carefully observe what made other games successful,
            especially in their early development.</p>
        <p>Want to work as a data scientist or business analyst? Learn Python, and focus your attention to the Pandas,
            SciKitLearn, Numpy, and Matplotlib libraries. Learn Matlab while you’re at it.</p>
        <p>Sure you might not have a goal in mind right now, and that’s totally normal. Your choice in the matter does
            not have to be carefully selected either way, because no matter what you end up learning, picking up a
            second language will never be as difficult as the first one. <strong>Programming paradigms
                transfer.</strong> Syntax can vary widely but computational techniques and patterns become extremely
            obvious to you after your first one.</p>
        <p>So go out there, have fun, and most importantly, never stop learning.</p>

        <h2>Footnote on Java for AP Computer Science</h2>
        <p>Whether or not you end up learning Java first, you will, without a doubt, have to learn Java for AP Computer
            Science. You may or may not like Java, but it is the chosen tool for the job (that is, for learning Object
            Oriented Programming and other Computer Science topics). Many will argue that it is not the best choice, and
            some colleges are even going as far as replacing their Java-focused curricula with Python. In any case, Java
            has some syntactical features that, without a doubt, equip you with accountability and knowledge about what
            your program is actually doing, which has found appeal in the classroom setting.</p>
